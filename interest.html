      <h2>Running</h2>
      <p>I have been running consistently since I was in middle school. I am currently running 70-75 miles each week and currently compete for RPI in the NCAA. Follow me on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/6145460">Strava</a>!

        <h2>Biking</h2>
        <p>I got into biking my sophomore year of college during remote classes. On the cross-country team at RPI, we would organize rides for people who also liked to bike. 
          I also log my bike activity on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/6145460">Strava</a>. Since getting my bike, my rate of broken bones has gone up 200%, but I might just be getting old.

        <h2>Dunebuggy</h2>
        <p>This past summer I was working in DC most of the time, but when I was home I was working on rebuilding a 1968 Meyers Manx Dunebuggy with my Grandfather. 
          This dunebuggy was rebuilt with a Volkswagen engine that a guy in Florida worked on over the winter. Its standerd and I only stalled it one the highway one time. 
           
          <br>(The pictures below in order: The chassis of the dunbuggy, repainted with new engine; the body before sandblasting; nearly finished)</p>
