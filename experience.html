          <h2>Undergradute Research</h2>
          <h3>August 2020 - May 2021</h3>
          <h4>Troy, NY</h4>
          <p>During my sophomore year, I worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rastoginidhi" target="_blank">Dr. Nidhi Rastogi</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~gittea/"> Dr. Alex Gittens</a> on a series of Natural Language Processing and Optimizaion projects that focued on malware threat analysis and truth detection.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Going into this reasearch opportunity, I did not have much experience with natural language processing, but I was familiar with malware characteristics, so we spent the first part of the research time reviewing papers on 
            entity extraction and relationship prediction. Then we worked on developping our own entity and relationship extraction technique that was specifically for threat reports. This was done in Python, primarily using the Pytorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn libraries.
            The knowledge graph part of this project was done with Neo4j, however I focued primarily on the entity and relationship extraction part. You can find the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05571", target="_blank">here</a>. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The second major area focused on estimating trustworthiness. We examined an optimization algorithm from a paper by Google. The paper that we examined had ample training data to work with (i.e. multiple sources of the same fact to compare) while our dataset was much smaller. Therefore, our goal was to improve upon the algorithm so
            that it would work well on our smaller dataset. We developped the code base for the algorithm proposed in the paper (in Python). As we adjusted the algorithm, we found that when scalling it down, the opportunity for the model to converge was restricted and often times it would reach an unreasonable result. We were able to adjust the model
            so that it would converge for texts within our domain, however expanding outside of our domain (cybersecurity reports) was problematic and suffered in accuracy.

          <h3>Feb 2020 - May 2020</h3>
          <h4>Troy, NY</h4>
          <p>
          During my second semester at RPI, I worked at the Advising and Learning Assistance Center (<a href="https://info.rpi.edu/advising-learning-assistance">ALAC</a>) for Computer Science 1. This involved weekly sessions where students could come and ask questions on homework, lecture excercises or anything else from Computer Science 1. In many cases 
          the sessions consisted of helping students debug their code and explaining the logic behind calculations. Before sessions, each week I would review homework for that week and work out a solution to the homework.

          <h2>HackRPI</h2>
          <h3>Nov 2019</h3>
          <h4>Troy, NY</h4>
          <p>During my first semester at RPI, I competed in 2 hackathons (This is the second of which). For this hackathon I worked with 3 friends to develop an applicaiton and algorithm that could predict and find missing family members. This was designed to be used after a natural disaster to help account for people and reconnect seperated
            families. Our project was inspired by the 2012 film "The Impossible". Our goal was to make it as lightweight as possible run efficiently on weak wifi signal <br><br>I worked on the backend of the application (database configuration and querying) and the algorithm that was used to predict the links between missing family members. Due the time limit on development, the algortihm implementation was designed with restrictions like not accounting for specialized cultural naming convenctions. 
            It would be improved to allow the orgnaization using the application to specify what region they are in so that preprocessing data would be less time consuming. Our submission can be found on the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/find-disaster-relief#updates">Devpost Page</a>.<br>

          <h3>Oct 2019</h3>
          <h4>Manhattan, NY</h4>
          <p>
            In 2019, I competed at the Mount Sinai Ichan School of Medicine Hackathon. Our goal was to design a product that would would improve an apsect of their patients lives with a focus on artificial intelligence. My team developped an application and analytics library for patients suffering with Type 2 diabetes. Our primary focus was on patients that did not qualify for an automated tracking system. I focued on configuring the database and connecting the analytics to the UI as well as ensuring any sensitive information was encrypted in transit. After the base of our app was done, I worked on building an Alexa 
            command set for patients to report their data and hear analytic results.

          <h4>Xi'an, Shaanxi, China</h4>
          <p>
            Merit-Based Scholarship to study Chinese Language and Culture in Xi'an. For the summer semester I lived with a host family in Xi'an. I studied at <a href="https://english.nwu.edu.cn">Northwest University</a> and attended 4 hours of language classes in the morning and 4 hours of activity in the afternoon that consisted of cultural classes, volunteering, and language study. 
            <br><br>At the end of the program we took a HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) exam to evaluate our language success. I achieved HSK Level 2 in speaking and comprehension (writing was not tested). Throughout my university career, I have continued to learn Mandarin with the coursework in RPI's foreign language department.
